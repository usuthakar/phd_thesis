	Abstract = {The Worldwide LHC Computing Grid (WLCG) today includes more than 150 computing centres where more than 2 million jobs are being executed daily and petabytes of data are transferred between sites. Monitoring the computing activities of the LHC experiments, over such a huge heterogeneous infrastructure, is extremely demanding in terms of computation, performance and reliability. Furthermore, the generated monitoring flow is constantly increasing, which represents another challenge for the monitoring systems. While existing solutions are traditionally based on Oracle for data storage and processing, recent developments evaluate NoSQL for processing large-scale monitoring datasets. NoSQL databases are getting increasingly popular for processing datasets at the terabyte and petabyte scale using commodity hardware. In this contribution, the integration of NoSQL data processing in the Experiment Dashboard framework is described along with first experiences of using this technology for monitoring the LHC computing activities.},

	Abstract = {The automation of operations is essential to reduce manpower costs and improve the reliability of the system. The Site Status Board (SSB) is a framework which allows Virtual Organizations to monitor their computing activities at distributed sites and to evaluate site performance. The ATLAS experiment intensively uses the SSB for the distributed computing shifts, for estimating data processing and data transfer efficiencies at a particular site, and for implementing automatic exclusion of sites from computing activities, in case of potential problems. The ATLAS SSB provides a real-time aggregated monitoring view and keeps the history of the monitoring metrics. Based on this history, usability of a site from the perspective of ATLAS is calculated. The paper will describe how the SSB is integrated in the ATLAS operations and computing infrastructure and will cover implementation details of the ATLAS SSB sensors and alarm system, based on the information in the SSB. It will demonstrate the positive impact of the use of the SSB on the overall performance of ATLAS computing activities and will overview future plans.},

However, the development of such large-scale JavaScript web applications presents new challenges, in particular with regard to code sustainability and team-based work. We present an approach that meets the challenges of large-scale JavaScript web application design and development, including client-side model-view-controller architecture, design patterns, and JavaScript libraries. Furthermore, we show how the approach leads naturally to the encapsulation of the data source as a web API, allowing applications to be easily ported to new data sources. The Experiment Dashboard framework is used for the development of applications for monitoring the distributed computing activities of virtual organisations on the Worldwide LHC Computing Grid. We demonstrate the benefits of the approach for large-scale JavaScript web applications in this context by examining the design of several Experiment Dashboard applications for data processing, data transfer and site status monitoring, and by showing how they have been ported for different virtual organisations and technologies.},

	Abstract = { The CMS experiment is currently developing a computing system capable of serving, processing and archiving the large number of events that will be generated when the CMS detector starts taking data. During 2004 CMS undertook a large scale data challenge to demonstrate the ability of the CMS computing system to cope with a sustained data-taking rate equivalent to 25\% of startup rate. Its goals were: to run CMS event reconstruction at CERN for a sustained period at 25 Hz input rate; to distribute the data to several regional centers; and enable data access at those centers for analysis. Grid middleware was utilized to help complete all aspects of the challenge. To continue to provide scalable access from anywhere in the world to the data, CMS is developing a layer of software that uses Grid tools to gain access to data and resources, and that aims to provide physicists with a user friendly interface for submitting their analysis jobs. This paper describes the data challenge experience with Grid infrastructure and the current development of the CMS analysis system.},

For CMS and the operation of centralized workflows, the monitoring of how many production jobs are running and pending in the Glidein WMS production pools is very important. The Dashboard Site Status Board (SSB) provides a very flexible framework to collect, aggregate and visualize data. The CMS production monitoring team uses the SSB to define the metrics that have to be monitored and the alarms that have to be raised. During the integration of CMS production monitoring into the SSB, several enhancements to the core functionality of the SSB were required; They were implemented in a generic way, so that other VOs using the SSB can exploit them. Alongside these enhancements, there were a number of changes to the core of the SSB framework. This paper presents the details of the implementation and the advantages for current and future usage of the new features in SSB.},

As part of the activities of the Experiment Support group in CERN's IT department, and reinforced by effort from the EGI-InSPIRE project, we present work aimed at common solutions across all LHC experiments. Such solutions allow us not only to optimize development manpower but also offer lower long-term maintenance and support costs. The main areas cover Distributed Data Management, Data Analysis, Monitoring and the LCG Persistency Framework. Specific tools have been developed including the Hammer Cloud framework, automated services for data placement, data cleaning and data integrity (such as the data popularity service for CMS, the common Victor cleaning agent for ATLAS and CMS and tools for catalogue/storage consistency), the Dashboard Monitoring framework (job monitoring, data management monitoring, File Transfer monitoring) and the Site Status Board. This talk focuses primarily on the strategic aspects of providing such common solutions and how this relates to the overall goals of long-term sustainability and the relationship to the various WLCG Technical Evolution Groups.},

	Abstract = {We are now in a phase change of the CMS experiment where people are turning more intensely to$\backslash$n physics analysis and away from construction. This brings a lot of challenging issues with respect to$\backslash$n monitoring of the user analysis. The physicists must be able to monitor the execution status,$\backslash$n application and grid-level messages of their tasks that may run at any site within the CMS Virtual$\backslash$n Organisation. The CMS Dashboard Task Monitoring project provides this information towards individual$\backslash$n analysis users by collecting and exposing a user-centric set of information regarding submitted$\backslash$n tasks including reason of failure, distribution by site and over time, consumed time and efficiency.$\backslash$n The development was user-driven with physicists invited to test the prototype in order to assemble$\backslash$n further requirements and identify weaknesses with the application.},

	Abstract = {During the first two years of data taking, the CMS experiment has collected over 20 PetaBytes of data and processed and analyzed it on the distributed, multi-tiered computing infrastructure on the WorldWide LHC Computing Grid. Given the increasing data volume that has to be stored and efficiently analyzed, it is a challenge for several LHC experiments to optimize and automate the data placement strategies in order to fully profit of the available network and storage resources and to facilitate daily computing operations. Building on previous experience acquired by ATLAS, we have developed the CMS Popularity Service that tracks file accesses and user activity on the grid and will serve as the foundation for the evolution of their data placement. A fully automated, popularity-based site-cleaning agent has been deployed in order to scan Tier-2 sites that are reaching their space quota and suggest obsolete, unused data that can be safely deleted without disrupting analysis activity. Future work will be to demonstrate dynamic data placement functionality based on this popularity service and integrate it in the data and workload management systems: as a consequence the pre-placement of data will be minimized and additional replication of hot datasets will be requested automatically. This paper will give an insight into the development, validation and production process and will analyze how the framework has influenced resource optimization and daily operations in CMS.},

	Abstract = {The Grid offers physicists far more resources than have previously been available by combining elements in computing centers around the world into a globally accessible resource. However, in order to harness this computing power many steps need to be performed for job creation and management and data discovery. ASAP (ARDA support for CMS analysis process) was developed to make this step as simple and straightforward as possible for physicists working on the Compact Muon Solenoid (CMS) experiment at CERN. ASAP transfers a local application to the Grid by packaging the application, discovering the location of input data then creating, submitting and monitoring jobs. One of the main components of the system is that users can delegate responsibility for their tasks to the ASAP server which can take actions on behalf of the user to ensure that tasks are completed successfully. The system can operate in the traditional push model but can also be used by agents executing on the Grid to pull jobs to the worker node for execution.},
